#
# NOTE: Paths to libraries are machine dependent and will very likely need adjustment. You can use e.g.
#   Intellij to copy the full path from its "External Libraries" in the "Project" tool windows.
#
# NOTE: Library path must be given with a FORWARD slash
#
# NOTE: You must remove the output folder if you make changes like deleting files since javac will check it for existing
#   stuff (Windows: "del /s /q mybuild")
